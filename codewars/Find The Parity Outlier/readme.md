You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

您将得到一个包含整数的数组（长度至少为3，但可能会非常大）。除了一个整数外，该数组要么完全由奇数整数组成，要么完全由偶数整数组成N。编写一个将数组作为参数并返回此“异常值”的方法N。
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)
